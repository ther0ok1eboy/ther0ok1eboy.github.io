> 🔐 **Description**: This guide walks you through techniques to bypass website Burpsuite detection mechanisms.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

Using proxy tools like **Burpsuite** to intercept and analyze traffic is common in penetration testing. However, websites often try to detect and block such tools. Let's see how to bypass these protections effectively.

---

### 🧭 User-Agent Detection

- **🔍 Detection**: Inspects the `User-Agent` header to check for non-browser requests.  
- **🛠️ Bypass**:
  - Modify the `User-Agent` in **Burp Suite** to mimic a real browser.
  - Navigate to **Proxy → Options → Match and Replace**.
  - Add a rule to replace Burp’s default User-Agent with one from a modern browser.

### 🔐 HTTPS Traffic Characterization

- **🔍 Detection**: Analyzes the certificate chain for Burp's self-signed certs.  
- **🛠️ Bypass**:
  - Install Burp's **CA certificate** on the browser/system.
  - Enable **"Generate CA-signed per-host certificates"** under **Proxy → Options**.
  - In advanced cases, forge the cert chain (⚠️ requires advanced skills).

---

### 🌐 IP Address or Port Detection

- **🔍 Detection**: Looks for traffic from typical proxy ports (e.g. 8080) or known proxy IPs.  
- **🛠️ Bypass**:
  - Change **Burp's listening port** (e.g. to 9090).
  - Try other proxy tools (e.g. **mitmproxy**, **Charles Proxy**).
  - Use **SOCKS proxy** or **SSH tunnel** to mask Burp.

### 📜 JavaScript Detection

- **🔍 Detection**: JS-based scripts detect anomalies or tool signatures in headers or DOM.  
- **🛠️ Bypass**:
  - Use **Tampermonkey** to neutralize detection scripts.
  - Emulate real user behavior with **browser plugins like FoxyProxy**.
  - Replay valid requests using **Burp Repeater** or **Intruder**.

---

### ⏱️ Time Delay Detection

- **🔍 Detection**: Monitors delays caused by proxies during request handling.  
- **🛠️ Bypass**:
  - Optimize network conditions to reduce latency.
  - Tune Burp’s performance via **Proxy → Options**.

---

### 🧬 TLS Feature Detection

- **🔍 Detection**: Analyzes TLS handshake metadata like cipher suites and protocol version.  
- **🛠️ Bypass**:
  - Adjust TLS settings in **Project Options → SSL/TLS**.
  - Use **mitmproxy** for advanced, fine-tuned TLS emulation.
  - Install Burpsuite plugin **[Awesome TLS](https://github.com/sleeyax/burp-awesome-tls)**.

💡 **Tip**: Always test in a safe, legal, and controlled environment. These techniques are for ethical hacking and red team use only.
