Description: How to install Network Card Driver on MECHREVO-15X.

## Description

I started installing Arch linux as soon as I got my new computer, and during the installation I could only connect to WIFI but not to a wired network.

```shell
$ ip addr # The results are as follows

1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: wlp2s0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether ae:20:f8:a3:0b:61 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff permaddr a8:e2:91:0a:79:9e
```

## Solution

Check if the corresponding module is loaded.

```shell
$ lspci -v | grep -A 15 -E "(net)" # The results are as follows

```
Kernel driver and kernel modules do not appear on Ethernet controller, as there is no module installed.

```shell
$ paru -S yt6801-dkms # dispatch
$ paru -S tuxedo-yt6801-dkms-git
$ sudo pacman -S linux-headers
$ rebote
 ```
