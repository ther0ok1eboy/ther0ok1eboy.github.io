Here's an example of how I've solved this problem.

- Here you can see that when you visit the homepage using the browser, it makes a 302 jump and then authenticates to WeChat, whereas when you visit it in the browser that comes with WeChat, it doesn't make a jump!

- You can find that when you visit WeChat, there is an additional OID field in the cookie, so when you visit using a browser, the cookie also carries the OID field, so that you don't jump to WeChat's authentication interface.

- Use **yakit** comes with a plug-in to modify the cookie, add the OID field can be, so that the use of the browser will be able to open the WeChat Official Account of the normal connection.
