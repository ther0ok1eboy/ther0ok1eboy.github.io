## Quick start

###  You should have a abroad server, i recommend [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).

The reasons why i recommand this platform are that it will give you one year and $300 to use its server for free only need a Visa Card. i believe your all partners who may exist a person has Visa Card. unfortunately, i only recommand [Vultr](http://bwg.yiqimaila.com/vt/).

- Configure your VPS:

- If you still follow me to there, you will get a JSON file that is V2ray needs, a KEY file and a PEM file.

### Test with V2ray on Window10 and Linux

+ Entrance your IPS server and configure it again. `su root`

    Startup BBR.

    ```shell
    $ echo "net.core.default_qdisc=fq" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
    $ echo "net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
    $ sysctl -p
    $ sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control
    $ lsmod | grep bbr
    ```

    Install V2ray.

    `$ bash <(curl -L -s https://install.direct/go.sh)` 

    Create directory.

    `$ mkdir /etc/your-domain` such as /etc/domain.com

    Copy json file to `/etc/v2ray` and copy KEY file and PEM file to `/etc/your-domain/`.

    Startup V2ray.

    `$ systemctl restart v2ray.service` 

+ Install V2ray under Window10.

    Download [V2ray-windows-64.zip](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/releases) and [V2rayN.zip](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN/releases).

    Unzip the V2rayN.zip and you will get V2rayN.exe which you should put it to the directory of V2ray-windows-64.

    Startup your V2rayG and configure it, this domain is your pretend address for which i recommand you add a vedio address because your VPS should run always.

+ Install V2ray under Linux.(you can see this article to view more details how to configure it)

    Test connection speed.

    ```shell
    $ wgetÂ https://raw.github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest.py
    $ chmod a+rx speedtest.py
    $ mv speedtest.py /usr/local/bin/speedtest
    $ chown root:root /usr/local/bin/speedtest
    $ speedtest
    ```
