Follow these steps to restore it:

### Reinstall `ca-certificates-utils` and `ca-certificates` packages

These packages contain the necessary CA certificates and tools to generate the `.crt` file.

```shell
$ sudo pacman -S ca-certificates ca-certificates-utils 
 ``` 

### Manually update the CA certificate store

Run the following command to extract and regenerate the certificate bundle:

```shell
$ sudo update-ca-trust extract
```

### Verify the file was created

Check if the `.crt` file has been generated:

```shell
$ ls -l /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```
